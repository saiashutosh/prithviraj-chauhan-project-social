				<br>
				<p class="p">Prithviraj and his younger brother Hariraja were born in Gujarat. According to the planetary positions of the sky at that time, were called auspicious. Prithviraj was born in the year 1166 CE. His father's name was Someshvara and his mother's name was Karpuradevi. His father was the king of Chahamana and his mother was a Kalachuri princess. Prithviraj and his younger brother were both brought up in Gujarat. Prithviraj was educated well. It is said that he had mastered 6 languages. Prithviraj Raso claims that he had learnt 14 languages. Prithviraj Raso has also claimed that he had mastered many subjects such as Mathematics, Medicine, History, military, defense, painting etc. The text also claims that Prithviraj was also very good at archery. He from a younger age had an interest in warfare and hence was able to learn the difficult military skills quickly. In the year 1177 CE, Someshvara passed away which led 11 years old Prithviraj Chauhan to ascend the throne with his mother as regent.</p>

				<br>
				<p class="p">Prithviraj Chauhan fell in love with Sanyogita (also known as Sanyukta), the daughter of Raja Jaichand of Kannauj. Her father did not approve of this match as Prithviraj belonged to a rival clan. So he arranged a "Swayamwara" for his daughter to which he invited all the eligible kings and princes except Prithviraj. In order to further insult him, he commissioned a clay statue of Prithviraj to be placed as the doorman. Prithviraj and Sanyukta came to know of this and devised a plan to outwit her father. On the day of the "Swayamwara", the bride-to-be ignored all the suitors present at the event and garlanded the clay statue. Then Prithviraj, who was hiding behind the statue, came out of his hiding and eloped with Sanyogita, taking her to Delhi.</p>
				<p class="p">Upon becoming the king he set out on several campaigns in order to expand his territories. Some conflicts arised such as with Nagarjuna, Bhadanakas and Chandelas. At that time, Muhammad of Ghor consolidated his power in the territory to the west of the Chahamanas, conquering Peshawar, Sindh and Punjab. He shifted his base from Ghazna to Punjab, and made attempts to expand his empire eastwards, which brought him to conflict with Prithviraj.</p>
				<p class="p">The first battle of Tarain, began in the year 1190 CE. Before this battle started Muhammad Ghor had captured Tabarhinda which was a part of Chahamana. The news reached the year of Prithviraj and he was furious. He launched a campaign towards that place. Ghor after capturing Tabarhinda had decided that he would go back to his base but when he heard about Prithviraj's attack, he decided to hold his army and put up a fight. The two armies clashed and there were many casualties. Prithviraj's army defeated the army of Ghor, which resulted in Ghor being injured but he somehow escaped but some sources says he was captured but forgiven by Prithviraj. Meanwhile, Ghor wanted to take revenge and returned with preparations to avenge his defeat. He gathered an army of 120,000 men. He then marched towards the Chahamana kingdom. Prithviraj had been left without any allies as a result of his wars against the neighbours Hindu kings. After a brief fight with Prithviraj, the army of divisions of Muhammad Ghor pretended to retreat according to Muhammad's strategy. Muhammad Ghor then captured Prithviraj.</p>

				<h1 class="h1">Death</h1>
				<br>
				<p class="p">According to Prithviraj Raso, Prithviraj was taken to Ghazna and was blinded and has kept the building which was close to the court and was close to the room of Muhammad Ghor. Prithviraj Chauhan was planning to kill Muhammad Ghor and requested Ghor to organise a archery event. When Prithviraj got a bow and arrows he killed Ghor by the help of his friend and poet Chand Bardai. It is not clear how he died and when. Many medieval sources suggest that Prithviraj was taken to Ajmer by Muhammad of Ghor where he was kept as a Ghurid vassal. After sometimes Prithviraj Chauhan rebelled against Muhammad Ghor and was later killed for treason.</p>
